# RNAseq_2022_Finalproject

## Description
This study accomplish a differential expression analysis of RNAseq data from isolated dermal endothelial cells from diabetic and control patients.

## Motivation
According to the [first *Global report on diabetes](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241565257)* of the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of adults living with diabetes has almost quadrupled since 1980 to 422 million adults. This dramatic rise is largely due to the rise in type 2 diabetes [[1](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241565257)]. 
Since diabetes has a high prevalence in the whole world and is a major cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke and lower limb amputation, this disease has been one of the most studied diseases and an important approach to understand its genetic fundaments is transcriptomics. RNAseq data analysis such as the one presented here are important to establish a complete biological scenario of diabetes causes and implicated processes.
