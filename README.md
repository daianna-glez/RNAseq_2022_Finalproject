# RNAseq_2022_Finalproject

## Description
This study executes a differential gene expression analysis using RNA-seq data of isolated dermal endothelial cells from diabetic and control patients.

## Motivation
According to the [first global report on diabetes](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241565257) of the World Health Organization, the number of adults living with diabetes has almost quadrupled since 1980. This dramatic increment is largely attibuted to the prevalence of type 2 diabetes [[1](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789241565257)]. Given its world-wide high prevalence and major health consequences, this disease represents a main field of research. Transcriptomic studies such as the one presented here help comprehend the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to, or resulting from diabetes.
